# Schmoo Social

**Schmoo Social** is a simple social media web app for sharing the best (and shortest!) silly jokes on the internet.

It's created and developed by **Mario Yordanov** solely as a training exercise in web development.

**Tech stack:** 
- JavaScript
- Lit (web components)
- Page (routing)
- Back4App (backend)
- webpack (bundler) 

**Pages:**
- [x] Home page with all posts, sorted by date, paginated
- [x] Profile page with all posts by current user, sorted by date, paginated
- [x] Favourites page with all posts liked by the current user, sorted by date, paginated
- [x] Settings page (with just logout and profile picture upload for now)
- [x] Details page with selected user post and comments

**Features :**
- [x] Users can register, login, upload profile picture
- [x] Users can submit text posts
- [x] Users can 'like' posts (and remove the 'like')
- [x] Users can comment on posts 

**Some future goals:**
- [] Search page
- [] Additional options for comments
- [] Additional loading animations
- [] Feed sorting options

By its nature as a training project **Schmoo Social** is ever evolving and never complete. It may have some missing features , bugs or quirky behaviours as well as a general inefficiency. But overall there were some invaluable lessons learned.

**What I learned:**
1. Careful planning of a core handful of features  can save you many hours of coding
2. Nailing your app design and prototyping beforehand can save you many hours of coding
3. Knowing your instruments well can save you... guess what... many hours of coding
